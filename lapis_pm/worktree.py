"""Per-task git worktree lifecycle for shaped-agent dispatch.

Why this module exists: `_runner.py` operated directly on
`/srv/git/<repo>-working/` until 2026-04-23, which meant concurrent
shaped-agent runs interleaved their `git checkout/commit/push` sequences
— producing PR #15 (empty) and PR #16 (two components' work mashed
together) on 2026-04-22. See mem `fix/lapis-pm-runner-shared-working-tree-race`.

WORKTREE_ROOT is the single source of truth for the worktree path,
imported by `agents_core.claude_queue_runner` for its startup sweep.

## Python pip isolation invariant

Fixer worktrees must not mutate host-global Python state. On 2026-04-24 a
fixer ran `pip install -e .` from inside its worktree, writing an editable-
install pointer into `~/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/`. When
`teardown_worktree` later removed the worktree, `pip show agents-core` still
claimed installed but `from agents_core import ...` raised `ModuleNotFoundError`
host-wide, breaking `mem`, `lapis-pm`, and all transitive consumers.
See mem key `fix/lapis-pm-fixer-worktree-mutates-host-pip-2026-04-24`.

The fix: `setup_worktree` sets `PYTHONUSERBASE=<worktree>/.pyuserbase` and
`PIP_USER=yes` in the shaped agent's subprocess environment. Any `pip install`
the agent runs defaults to `--user` and lands under the worktree. When
`teardown_worktree` removes the worktree tree, `.pyuserbase` is cleaned up
automatically. The host `~/.local/` is never touched.

This isolation covers *Python pip installs only*. systemd unit modifications,
mem.db writes outside the fixer's target scope, and other side effects are
separate concerns (file them as separate targets if they bite).

    """Create a detached worktree at WORKTREE_ROOT/<task_id>.

    Symlinks the parent clone's `.claude/` into the worktree root because
    `git worktree add` only materializes the tracked working tree, and
    `.claude/` (containing settings.json, hooks, and per-project
    auto-memory) is gitignored. The load-bearing `chub-inject.py`
    SessionStart hook is registered at user level in
    `~/.claude/settings.json` and fires for every `claude -p` invocation
    regardless of this symlink — so the living-context invariant
    (agents-core #7 / lapis-pm #2) is enforced there. The symlink
    carries per-project auto-memory + any local per-repo permissions
    into the worktree cwd.

    A missing `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/settings.json` in the parent clone
    is a soft warning (emitted to stderr, captured by the claude-queue
    runner into the task output markdown), not a fatal. Dispatch
    proceeds; the shaped agent simply runs without repo-specific
    `@chub:` expansion and/or without per-repo hooks/permissions.

    Known constraint: the symlink means concurrent workers share one
    `.claude/settings.json` + `.claude/projects/*/memory/`. Safe at
    CLAUDE_QUEUE_WORKERS=2; revisit before raising beyond 4.

    Returns a WorktreeHandle whose .env dict must be merged into the
    shaped-agent subprocess environment (see _runner.py). This prevents
    `pip install` from writing to the host's ~/.local/ — see module
    docstring and mem `fix/lapis-pm-fixer-worktree-mutates-host-pip-2026-04-24`.
